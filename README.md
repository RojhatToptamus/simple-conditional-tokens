# simple-conditional-tokens
This project contains simplified smart contracts and related scripts for Gnosis's Conditional Tokens Framework, tailored for use in non-combinatorial markets. Typically, conditional token frameworks are employed in contexts without Combinatorial Markets; therefore, these contracts are revised for such use cases. 

## Building and Testing with Forge
This project uses Foundry, for building and testing smart contracts. 

### Building

```shell
forge build

### Testing
